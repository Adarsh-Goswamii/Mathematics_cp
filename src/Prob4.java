/* PROB 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

// Approach 1: iterate from 100 to 999 O(n^2)
// Approach 2: Check for the first and last digit if they match || first+1(carry) = last.
//             Multiplication is costly operation this can reduce many multiplications.
// Approach 3: We already know our ans lies between 999*999 and 10000 so just iterate from back. This
// seems ok but its not necessary that if u find a palin there exits some 3 digits value for which
// it product is palindrome.
