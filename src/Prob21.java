/**
 * PROBLEM 21:
 * Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide
 * evenly into n).
 * If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each
 * of a and b are called amicable numbers.
 *
 * For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110;
 * therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142;
 * so d(284) = 220.

 * Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

 * But that will be of complexity O(10^8).
 * Well we can obviously do that without any problem.
