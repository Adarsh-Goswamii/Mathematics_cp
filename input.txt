Intuition: We need to find all the factors of number and
as the no is 10,000 we can just find sum of factors for
every number. And then check for pairs

But that will be of complexity O(10^8).
Well we can obviously do that without any problem.

We can surely do some minor optimizations
(i). from O(n^2) to O(n* sqrt(n))
